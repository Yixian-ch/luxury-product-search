# Feel De Luxe (temp-luxury)

A minimal luxury-product browser for non-commercial information and testing.

Quick start

- Start backend (from project root):

```bash
cd server/python
./start.sh
```

- Start frontend (from project root):

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Data lives in `server/data/products.json`. The frontend component `src/LuxuryProductSearch.js` provides search, filters, brand selection, pagination and product detail view.

This README is intentionally short — open issues or the code for more details.
